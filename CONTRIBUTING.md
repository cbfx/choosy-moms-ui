# Contributing

## Coding
- Always use a feature branch that's named `Issue-1-add-some-feature`. If there's no issue for the branch, you can leave the "Issue-X" part out but it's always good to track your features or bug fixes.

## Other notes
- Never force push master
- Never push directly to master, instead use feature branches from your own fork.
- Always wait for a +1 before merging.
